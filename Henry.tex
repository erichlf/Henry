\begin{abstract}
Henry's Semi-Analytic Solution to Seawater Intrusion has been used as a 
benchmark for numerical solutions for many years. However, its ability to use 
parameters that are more representative of narrow zones of dispersion has been 
limited. The method used by Henry to evaluate his analytic solution has been 
tempered by the limited ability to increase the number of Fourier Coefficients 
used, and this may possibly lead to the inability of those methods to solve 
Henry's Problem using parameters that would simulate narrow zones of dispersion. 
Newton's Method however, is a more robust numerical method than those previously 
used, and therefore will not limit the number of coefficients used. The robust 
nature of Newton's Method leads to the ability to use an increased number of 
Fourier coefficients, and therefore will allow for parameters that can simulate 
narrower zones of dispersion.
